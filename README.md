# CANsensor
Collect sensor data over CAN
This project is about using CAN bus at home to collect measurements at different points of the property. Each CAN node is a Teensy 3.1 or 3.2 connected to a number of sensors e.g. via I2C. The measurements are collected in a server database. The server would be implemented with a Raspberry PI.
